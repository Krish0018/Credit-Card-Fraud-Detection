# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

### About the project
This project is all about to find the fraud credit card transaction out of the normal transactions.
Usually the normal transaction are big in amount but the fraud transactions usually small in comparison of normal on. The idea behind that transaction is normally people ignore small transaction.


### Tool Used
Used Python for data analysis for that particular dataset. Libraries used for this project are:
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
sklearn

### Installation
for numpy
```pip install numpy```


for Pandas
```pip install pandas```


For Matplotlib
```pip install matplotlib```


For Seaborn
```pip install seaborn```

For Sklearn
```pip install scikit-learn```



### Key Insights

To find out the number of fraud transaction, I used the countplot so we can have a proper idea how many this kind of transaction available.

And to understand how a fraud and normal transaction look like, I used the scatter plot and compared both.

From above, we can see that fraud transactions were not continous and not higher in terms of amount.
